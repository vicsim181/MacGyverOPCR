Help MacGyver to escape the maze!!

To be able to run the game, you will need the following tools:

-Python3.8: https://www.python.org/downloads/
-Pygame 2.6: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

The game:
MacGyver is trapped in a maze, which exit is protected by a guardian.
In order to escape, MacGyver needs to collect 3 items (a needle, a plastic tube and some ether).
He will then be able to make a syringe.
Of course he will need to find his way through the maze and reach the guardian.
If he collected all the items, he will fight successfuly and will be able to escape!
If he didn't, well...

Good luck!
